For a detailed explanation about the main pillars of the mechanical design of the Sigma and Sigmax, please check the repository [BCN3D Sigma - Mechanics](https://github.com/BCN3D/BCN3DSigma-Mechanics).

Regarding the Sigmax, the main objectives were:

 - Sigma and Sigmax must share as many references as possible

 - The Sigmax is targeting a more demanding customer, hence its performance and reliability must excel. 

The first goal was accomplished with a careful mechanical design, which ultimately allowed us to just modify few parts in the X and Z axis, change some wiring references and widen the aluminium frame. 

However, such big sheet metal parts, especially the frame, can be a challenge. Luckily, our previous experience in sheet metal manufacturing technologies eased the design process and the communication with our partners, so the suppliers have been able to provide high quality components since the very beginning of the production. 

The second goal has been achieved by improving the performance of certain key subassemblies. The most important change can be seen in the extruders. The Sigmax features the globally renowned Bondtech drivegears. These exceptional pieces of hardware, together with mighty stepper motors with planetary  gearbox has increased dramatically the reliability of the printer.

In addition, the Sigmax can be covered, a key feature for those intending to print large models with technical materials which may tend to warp. In order to ensure the safe operation of the printer, some heatsinks have been added in the most critical stepper motors.
